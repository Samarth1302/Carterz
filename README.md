This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
Used many utilities and node packages like MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, CryptoJS, React-Toastify and JWT for proper functionality and secure management of users.
The project is based on the learnings from Code with Harry (Next.js playlist)
